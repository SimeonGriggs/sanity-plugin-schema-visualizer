# Sanity Plugin Schema Visualizer

A custom Tool to visually represent schema registered in a Sanity Studio. 

Not intended to be feature complete or as a schema builder/editor. 

There are known issues:

- [ ] Full schema is not displayed, and some inner fields are not retrieved
- [ ] On the initial load, the "card" for each document schema is shown in a horizontal bar, not grouped, but can be dragged into position
- [ ] The arrows aren't great

## Installation

```sh
npm install sanity-plugin-schema-visualizer
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import {schemaVisualizer} from 'sanity-plugin-schema-visualizer'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...all other plugins
    schemaVisualizer()
  ],
})
```

Optionally, you can configure some defaults for displayed and hidden document cards.

```ts
schemaVisualizer({
  defaultSchemaTypes: ['movie'],
  hiddenSchemaTypes: ['person'],
})
```
